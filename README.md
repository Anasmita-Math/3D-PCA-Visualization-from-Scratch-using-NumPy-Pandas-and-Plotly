# 3D-PCA-Visualization-from-Scratch-using-NumPy-Pandas-and-Plotly
This project performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch using Python. It generates 3D synthetic data for two classes, applies standardization, computes the covariance matrix and eigenvectors manually, and visualizes the principal components in 3D using Plotly and Matplotlib for a clear understanding of PCAâ€™s working.
